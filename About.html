    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>A website that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet
        rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept
        payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.</p>
